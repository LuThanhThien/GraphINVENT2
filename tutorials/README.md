## Description
This directory contains guides on how to use GraphINVENT2. If viewing in a browser (recommended), simply click the link to the desired tutorial to view it.

## Tutorials
* [0_setting_up_environment](./0_setting_up_environment.md) : Instructions on how to set up the GraphINVENT2 virtual environment.
* [1_introduction](./1_introduction.md) : A quick introduction to GraphINVENT2. Uses the example dataset *gdb13_1K* to guide new users through Training and Generation jobs in the code.
* [2_using_a_new_dataset](./2_using_a_new_dataset.md) : A tutorial on how to use new datasets to train models in GraphINVENT2.
* [3_visualizing_molecules](./3_visualizing_molecules.md) : A quick guide on how to visualize grids of molecules using RDKit.
* [4_transfer_learning](./4_transfer_learning.md) : A guide on how to use GraphINVENT2 for transfer learning tasks.
* [5_benchmarking](./5_benchmarking.md) : A brief note on how to benchmark molecular generative models.
* [6_preprocessing_large_datasets](./6_preprocessing_large_datasets.md) : A guide on how to preprocess large datasets in GraphINVENT2.
* [7_reinforcement_learning](./7_reinforcement_learning.md) : A guide on how to fine-tune GraphINVENT2 models for molecular optimization and *de novo* design tasks using reinforcement learning.

## Comments
If a tutorial doesn't exist for something you'd like to do, contact [me](https://github.com/rociomer) and I'll be happy to create one (if I think others would benefit from it and I have time). Similarly, if you find and error in a tutorial, please let me know so that I can correct it.
