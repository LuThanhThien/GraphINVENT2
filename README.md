# GraphINVENT2

![cover image](./cover-image.png)

## Description
GraphINVENT2 is a platform for graph-based molecular generation and optimization. It uses a tiered deep neural network architecture to probabilistically generate new molecules a single bond at a time, and reinforcement learning to guide the model towards better molecules. GraphINVENT2 captures the core functionalities of GraphINVENT in a smaller, more user-friendly package.

This is not only a newer version of GraphINVENT, but it is also the only version being actively maintained. Please use this version in all new uses of GraphINVENT.

## Prerequisites
* Anaconda or Miniconda with Python 3.6 or 3.8.
* (for GPU-training only) CUDA-enabled GPU.

## Instructions and tutorials
For detailed guides on how to use GraphINVENT, see the [tutorials](./tutorials/).

## Examples
An example training set is available in [./data/gdb13_1K/](./data/gdb13_1K/). It is a small (1K) subset of GDB-13 and is already preprocessed.
